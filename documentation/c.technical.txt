  1) New Node Manager Script (manage_newNode.py)
    # Await a broadcast from existing nodes on the mesh over the designated socket informing the manager script that a new node has joined the network. 
      -- Broadcast is sent from the Mesh Update script on the node that makes the initial handshake with the new node.
      -- This broadcast contains the hostname of the new node along with the ip address it joined with. Its formatted as a 2 token string.
    # Upon recieving a broadcast from a node, the broadcast is deconstructed and used to fill out a new entry in the NodeList table in the MeshManagement database.
      -- A function takes the row count,increments it by 1, then assigns the new value as the ID, as well as assigning it as part of the nodeName (nN where N is the ID) and as the the Subnet ID for the ULA.
